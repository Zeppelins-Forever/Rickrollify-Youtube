# Youtube Rickrollify

Enhance your browsing experience with Rickrollify! Is your browser giving you up? Youtube recommendations letting you down? This extension turns every YouTube thumbnail into Rick Astley's Never Gonna Give You Up.

This is a fork of [MagicJinn/MrBeastify-Youtube](https://github.com/MagicJinn/MrBeastify-Youtube), a fantastic extension which deserves all sorts of praise, I just modified it a tiny.

Instructions on how to port and modify the extension can be found [on MagicJinn's page](https://github.com/MagicJinn/MrBeastify-Youtube/issues/16) or in "how-to-upload.txt".
